Back in 2019, during one of my web lectures, I wrote my very first lines of code — a simple HTML table for a project. This humble piece of code sparked a flame within me, igniting my passion to become a web developer one day. 💻✨ As a beginner, it was a small but significant step that introduced me to the world of web development and opened the door to endless possibilities. Little did I know that this initial experience would set me on a thrilling journey towards mastering the art of web development and turning my dreams into reality. 🚀🌐
